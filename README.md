# My Advanced LLM Project

This repository demonstrates an **advanced* pipeline for training a ChatGPT-like or Claude-like model.  The pipeline includes:


** Pre-Training** (optional)
** Supervised Fine-Tuning (3FT)*
** Reward Modeling (pairwise preference data)
** RLHF (pconceptual PPO script)

=== Setup ===

1. **Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. **Prepare data**

"- Place raw text in `data/raw/` for pre-training. 
"- Place instructionâ€™response data in `data/sft/` for SFT. 
"- Place pairwise preference data in `data/reward/` for reward modeling.

3. **Edit Configs**

- Adjust hyperparameters in `configs/`.

4. **Run** 

- Pre-train:

```bash
bash scripts/run_pretrain.sh
```

- SFT:

```bash
bash scripts/run_sft.sh
```

- Reward model:

```bash
bash scripts/run_reward_model.sh
```

- RLHF (placeholder):

```bash
bash scripts/run_rlhf.sh
```

5. **Inference**  

  - Load a checkpoint and generate text:

```bash
python src/inference.py
```



=== Notes ===



- For large models, configure [Accelerate](https://github.com/huggingface/accelerate) and possibly use [DeepSpeed](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed) or FSDP.

- SFT, Reward Modeling, and RLHF require carefully curated datasets. 
- The code here is a demonstration scaffold; modify to your needs and environment.
